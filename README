SETUP : 
	probably want to set your path to 

	export PATH="$(pwd)/test:$(pwd)/util:$PATH"

	then for the version that is being worked on:

	export PATH="$(pwd)/src/perl5_bubble:$PATH"	


TODO : 
	choose a disipline for how parts of the directory tree find each other. 

	e.g. tdd_loop expects to be run in the test dir... so $LUMPIEDEVROOT might be right.
