NDA's are what they are... so we'll need to make up some generic example hosts. 

note, nested parens tend to not work well.

Generate up some example or reference test sets. 



One way to figure out what lumpie can do is to get some names and try to make sense out of them. 


./gen_random_ipv4_24  to get some IP addresses or ./gen_random_ipv4_24_host a few times. 

shell out the hostnames

e.g. 

for i in `/usr/bin/seq 1 64 ` ; do  
	./gen_random_ipv4_24_host | awk ' { print $5 } ' | lumpie 
done

and it's slow and you'd think you may find interesting things... and it takes a while. 
Most of the IPv4 space is ISP connections or not reverse mapped.   So much for that.
