# placeholder bits : 

# license : probably BSD, Artistic or MIT.  
   feel free to use it while not holding contributors accoutable for things that go wrong. 

# code of conduct :  Be kind to the kids. 
   Save the hate for someone who is not helping to save mindkind. 

# Contributing : Not until the license and code of conduct are figured out.
